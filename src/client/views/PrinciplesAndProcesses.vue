            <p>
                Efficasafe data is built purely on scientific evidence.
                Many medicinal product data is influenced by beliefs and traditions passed
                from one person to another, sometimes over generations. With natural medicines,
                this is especially true. As a result, the efficacy information of a variety
                of natural medicines can unfortunately be based largely on marketing claims,
                inaccurate extrapolations and even, in vitro studies.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading2" id="ReliableContributors" ref="anchor3">Reliable contributors</h3>
            <p>
                All Efficasafe contributors are certified,
                licensed health professionals with authority to practice in their area of specialty.
                The contributor group includes writers, researchers, and editors.
                Many of our contributors are active members or previous faculty members
                at universities and medical centers with significant faculty affiliation.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading2" id="ObjectiveAndUnbiased" ref="anchor4">Objective and unbiased</h3>
            <p>
                Efficasafe uses only objective and unbiased data.
                By pinpointing, evaluating, and applying systematic
                scientific information, search results are deemed reliable
                enough for traditional use. Objectivity is paramount in a contributor's
                approach to natural medicines. This includes no bias or conflicts of
                interest in the objective evaluation of the data.
                To further minimize potential conflicts,
                contributors are strictly forbidden to hold stock in the nutraceutical,
                pharmaceutical or food industries.

            <h3 class="heading2" id="ClinicallyPractical" ref="anchor5">Clinically practical</h3>
            <p>
                Going beyond just providing reliable scientific data,
                Efficasafe provides clinically practical information
                designed to support clinical decision-making by health professionals.

            <h3 class="heading2" id="SafetyBasedOnScience" ref="anchor6">Safety based on science</h3>
            <p>
                Each product monograph in the database and its Safety,
                Effectiveness and Interaction ratings are supported only
                by the best scientific evidence available. Subsequently,
                all evidence is systematically identified, evaluated,
                and then applied via the same benchmark of high standards
                used to evaluate evidence for other therapies.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading2" id="StandardsRemainStandards" ref="anchor7">Standards remain standards</h3>
            <p>
                Efficasafe believes that conventional therapies
                and alternative therapies should carry the exact
                same standards for evidence. While folklore and
                tradition are valuable, they do not serve Efficasafe’s
                purpose and therefore, are not considered as a reliable source of evidence.

            <h3 class="heading2" id="QualityAndQuantity" ref="anchor9">Quality and quantity</h3>
            <p>
                The number of studies reviewed by Efficasafe greatly
                exceeds those of competing search engines.
                This is a key differentiator for Efficasafe.
                The data process is continuous, with the latest updated
                information continually identified, evaluated, and appended to the database.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading2" id="ContinuousSearch" ref="anchor10">Continuous Search</h3>
            <p>
                Efficasafe continues to seek out the latest data via a myriad of mechanisms daily.
                All new data is assessed at the most granular detail and,
                if deemed relevant, added to the database based on previous findings.
                This approach empowers users to gain access to the most current, reliable,
                and relevant information on the efficacy of natural medicines.

            <p>
                Identifying data related to natural medicines is carried out via a systematic approach.
                Thorough literature searches are conducted through a variety of bibliographic
                databases using pin-point search criteria. This process is carried out for each new monograph.
                Searches are carried out using botanical names, synonyms, and/or scientific or chemical names.
                Databases are searched whenever appropriate.

                <span class="d-block inner-paragraph">
                    Research articles are selected only if they have the potential

                    The critical evaluation of all initially identified literature
                    is based upon the following defined criteria:

                <h4 class="d-block font-bold">Relevance</h4>
                <p>
                    The retention of literature that provides the most wealth
                    in data is used to further evaluate the data’s validity.
                    To be deemed relevant, the adequate addressing of an issue important
                    to health professionals must be included in the literature.
                    This, for the most part, includes information regarding product
                    safety and effectiveness. The information speaks about the action
                    mechanism or pharmacology as well as adverse interactions or lab test inference.
                    Any literature that does not address practical and relevant issues is excluded.

                    With the end goal being the design’s adequacy for providing valid results,
                    each study is reviewed based upon the methodology and study conduct.

            <p>
                The assessment of all new literature is contextually based on previous findings and utilized to determine data consistency. A higher level of confidence can be achieved by maintaining a higher level of consistency. This is directly related to the reliability of the body of information in its entirety.

            <h3 class="heading2" id="peerReview" ref="anchor15">Peer review</h3>
            <p>
                Through its peer review approach, Efficasafe addresses
                all multidisciplinary and multi-pronged database content.
                Multidisciplinary practitioners comprise the editorial review board.
                This includes those from the pharmaceutical, naturopathy, medicine,
                research, and nutrition industries, along with many others. 
                The peer review approach is used not only to ensure the reliability
                and accuracy of the content, but also to make it more practical and
                relevant for practitioners on a day-to-day basis.

            <p>
                The aspiration to stay current Is filled by reviewing content
                continuously from global sources. The continuous review of literature
                is conducted using more than 100 global journals.

            <p>
                Prioritization is given to literature based on its potential impact.
                Patient safety is paramount when concerns for safety are prioritized.
                High priority is given to content and added to the database immediately
                as fresh clinical trials are found to be synergistic or negative.

            <p>
                The area of natural medicine research is exploding.
                The information that health professionals have access to,
                and the sheer volume of that information is growing rapidly.
                By focusing on the information that is the most practical,
                Efficasafe assists users in getting the information that is most
                relevant while keeping efficiency as high as possible.
                With the continuation of enhancing both technological and editorial in nature,
                the database also helps users to identify clinical answers to their questions -
                on demand.
