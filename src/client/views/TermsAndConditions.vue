                    With respect to monthly license subscriptions, Customer will
                    provide Efficasafe with valid and updated credit card
                    information. Customer authorizes Efficasafe to charge such

                    Order Form(s) for the initial subscription term and any
                    renewal subscription term(s) in advance on the first of each
                    month (prorated for the initial month of any license
                    subscriptions). Customer is responsible for providing
                    complete and accurate billing and contact information to

                    1.4 Annual Subscriptions: Invoicing and Payment

                <p>
                    With respect to annual license subscriptions, Customer will
                    provide Efficasafe with valid and updated credit card
                    information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative
                    document reasonably acceptable to Efficasafe. If Customer
                    provides credit card information to Efficasafe, Customer
                    authorizes Efficasafe to charge such credit card for all
                    license subscriptions listed in the Order Form(s) for the
                    initial subscription term and any renewal subscription
                    term(s). Such charges shall be made annually in advance. If
                    the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method
                    other than a credit card, Efficasafe will invoice Customer

                    If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other
                    agreement for services is 30 days or more overdue, (or 10 or
                    more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has
                    authorized Efficasafe to charge to Customer’s credit card),
                    Efficasafe may, without limiting its other rights and
                    remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations under
                    such agreements so that all such obligations become
                    immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such
                    amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for
                    customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose
                    payment has been declined, Efficasafe will give Customer at

                    before suspending services to Customer.

                <p>
                    Efficasafe will not exercise its rights under the “Overdue
                    Charges” or “Suspension of Service and Acceleration” section
                    above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges
                    reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently
                    to resolve the dispute.
                </p>
                <h3 class="heading3">1.7 Taxes</h3>
                <p class="bottom-gap">
                    Efficasafe's fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties
                    or similar governmental assessments of any nature,
                    including, for example, value-added, sales, use or
                    withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever
                    (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer is responsible for paying
                    all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If
                    Efficasafe has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes
                    for which Customer is responsible under this section,
                    Efficasafe will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that
                    amount unless Customer provides Efficasafe with a valid tax
                    exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing
                    authority. For clarity, Efficasafe is solely responsible for
                    taxes assessable against it based on its income, property
                    and employees.

                    Order Form(s) at any time prior to the expiration of the
                    Trial Period. If Customer chooses not to purchase license
                    subscription(s), access to the Application will terminate
                    the expiration of the Trial Period. “End User” means, in the
                    case of an individual accepting this Master Service
                    Agreement on their own behalf, such individual, or, in the

                <p class="bottom-gap">
                    We may vary, replace or withdraw content and features
                    included within the Services and the range of payment
                    options may change in our sole discretion. We reserve the
                    right to modify the price of the Service for new or renewed
                    subscriptions, but already purchased subscriptions will not
                    be affected. For the avoidance of doubt, a subscription will
                    be considered a renewed subscription when payment is taken
                    to extend the period of subscription. For example, an annual
                    subscription which expires upon the anniversary of purchase
                    but which, either automatically or otherwise, renews at the
                    end of that period for a further year, shall be deemed a
                    renewal. It may not be practical for us to notify you in
                    advance of all changes to the content and features included
                    within the Services and you should continue to check
