                <h3>1.1 Subscriptions.</h3>
                <p>
                    Access to the Application is purchased via license
                    subscriptions on either a monthly or annual basis. With
                    respect to monthly license subscriptions for the
                    Application, (i) such subscriptions (i.e. the number of End
                    Users) may be decreased during the calendar month and (ii)
                    such subscriptions (i.e. the number of End Users) may be
                    increased during the calendar month at the then effective
                    pricing and will end on the same date as the original
                    license subscriptions. Customer agrees that its purchases of
                    license subscriptions are not contingent on the delivery of
                    any future functionality or features, or dependent on any
                    oral or written public comments made by Efficasafe regarding
                    future functionality or features.
                </p>
                <h3>1.2 Fees.</h3>
                <p>
                    Customer will pay all fees specified in the on-line order(s)
                    form completed and submitted by Customer (the “Order
                    Forms”). Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order
                    Form, (i) fees are based on license subscriptions purchased
                    and not actual usage, (ii) payment obligations are
                    non-cancelable (except as otherwise provided immediately
                    below) and fees paid are non-refundable, and (iii) monthly
                    license subscriptions (but not annual license subscriptions)
                    may be decreased with the corresponding decreased fees
                    applicable in the immediately following month. Customer
                    acknowledges and agrees that Efficasafe may revise its fee
                    schedule at any time and from time to time upon 30-days
                    prior written notice (posted on the website); provided, that
                    such changes shall not go into effect for annual
                    subscriptions until renewal thereof.
                </p>
                <h3>1.3 Monthly Subscriptions: Invoicing and Payment.</h3>
                <p>
                    With respect to monthly license subscriptions, Customer will
                    provide Efficasafe with valid and updated credit card
                    information. Customer authorizes Efficasafe to charge such
                    credit card for all license subscriptions listed in the
                    Order Form(s) for the initial subscription term and any
                    renewal subscription term(s) in advance on the first of each
                    month (prorated for the initial month of any license
                    subscriptions). Customer is responsible for providing
                    complete and accurate billing and contact information to
                    Efficasafe and notifying Efficasafe of any changes to such
                    information.
                </p>
                <h3>1.4 Annual Subscriptions: Invoicing and Payment.</h3>
                <p>
                    With respect to annual license subscriptions, Customer will
                    provide Efficasafe with valid and updated credit card
                    information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative
                    document reasonably acceptable to Efficasafe. If Customer
                    provides credit card information to Efficasafe, Customer
                    authorizes Efficasafe to charge such credit card for all
                    license subscriptions listed in the Order Form(s) for the
                    initial subscription term and any renewal subscription
                    term(s). Such charges shall be made annually in advance. If
                    the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method
                    other than a credit card, Efficasafe will invoice Customer
                    in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant
                    Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form,
                    invoiced fees are due 30 days from the invoice date.
                    Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate
                    billing and contact information to Efficasafe and notifying
                    Efficasafe of any changes to such information.
                </p>
                <h3>1.5 Suspension of Service and Acceleration.</h3>
                <p>
                    If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other
                    agreement for services is 30 days or more overdue, (or 10 or
                    more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has
                    authorized Efficasafe to charge to Customer’s credit card),
                    Efficasafe may, without limiting its other rights and
                    remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations under
                    such agreements so that all such obligations become
                    immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such
                    amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for
                    customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose
                    payment has been declined, Efficasafe will give Customer at
                    least 10 days’ prior notice that its account is overdue,
                    before suspending services to Customer.
                </p>
                <h3>1.6 Payment Disputes.</h3>
                <p>
                    Efficasafe will not exercise its rights under the “Overdue
                    Charges” or “Suspension of Service and Acceleration” section
                    above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges
                    reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently
                    to resolve the dispute.
                </p>
                <h3>1.7 Taxes.</h3>
                <p>
                    Efficasafe's fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties
                    or similar governmental assessments of any nature,
                    including, for example, value-added, sales, use or
                    withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever
                    (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer is responsible for paying
                    all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If
                    Efficasafe has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes
                    for which Customer is responsible under this section,
                    Efficasafe will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that
                    amount unless Customer provides Efficasafe with a valid tax
                    exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing
                    authority. For clarity, Efficasafe is solely responsible for
                    taxes assessable against it based on its income, property
                    and employees.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Customer will receive a temporary license for full access to
                    the Efficasafe website for 14 days (the “Trial Period”)
                    subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in this
                    Master License Agreement (other than the terms and

                    opportunity to purchase license subscriptions pursuant to
                    Order Form(s) at any time prior to the expiration of the
                    Trial Period. If Customer chooses not to purchase license
                    subscription(s), access to the Application will terminate
                    the expiration of the Trial Period. “End User” means, in the
                    case of an individual accepting this Master Service
                    Agreement on their own behalf, such individual, or, in the
                    case of an individual accepting this Master License
                    Agreement on behalf of a legal entity (e.g. a corporation or
                    limited liability company), an individual (i) who is
                    authorized by Customer to use the Application, (ii) who has
                    agreed to an End User Agreement and (iii), for whom Customer
                    has purchased a subscription (except during the Trial Period
                    when no purchase is necessary). End Users may include, for
                    example, employees, consultants, contractors and agents of
                    Customer, and third parties with which Customer transacts
